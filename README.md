# Fashion Item Classification using Fashion-MNIST

**Badr University in Assiut — School of Artificial Intelligence & Data Management**  
**Neural Networks Course Project**

---

## Problem Description

Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images. The goal of this project is to build a **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** neural network capable of classifying 28×28 grayscale fashion images into 10 clothing categories.

This project was designed to satisfy all academic requirements for the Neural Networks course, covering data preprocessing, model building, training with regularization, evaluation, experimentation, and visualization.

## Model Architecture

The MLP is a configurable fully connected network:

```
Input (784)
    ↓
Linear(784 → H1) → BatchNorm → Activation → Dropout(0.3)
    ↓
Linear(H1 → H2) → BatchNorm → Activation → Dropout(0.3)
    ↓
Linear(H2 → 10)   ← Output logits (Softmax applied by CrossEntropyLoss)
```

**Design choices:**
- **Batch Normalization:** Stabilizes and accelerates training by normalizing intermediate activations
- **Dropout (p=0.3):** Prevents overfitting by randomly deactivating neurons during training
- **Early Stopping:** Restores best weights when validation loss stops improving (patience=5)
- **LR Scheduler:** `ReduceLROnPlateau` halves the learning rate if val loss stagnates for 3 epochs

## Regularization Techniques

| Technique | Purpose | Effect |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Batch Normalization** | Normalizes layer activations | Faster convergence, more stable training |
| **Dropout (0.3)** | Randomly deactivates neurons | Reduces overfitting, improves generalization |
| **Early Stopping** | Stops when val loss stagnates | Prevents over-training, restores best model |
| **LR Scheduler** | Reduces LR when plateau | Fine-tuned convergence in later epochs |

## Future Improvements

1. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):** Replace the MLP with a CNN to exploit spatial structure in images, likely achieving 92%+ accuracy
2. **Data Augmentation:** Apply random flips, crops, and rotations to reduce overfitting
3. **Learning Rate Warmup:** Gradually increase LR at the start of training for more stable convergence
4. **Ensemble Methods:** Average predictions from multiple models to improve robustness
5. **Hyperparameter Search:** Use Optuna or Ray Tune for automated hyperparameter optimization
6. **Transfer Learning:** Fine-tune a pretrained ResNet or EfficientNet on Fashion-MNIST
